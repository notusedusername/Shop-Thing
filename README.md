# Shop-Thing
A simple ware register program for little shops

The program has some basic feature, it can store products barcode, name, price, and the number of pieces on storage.
You can manage the database on graphical UI. It is possible to add, modify, and delete records, and you can "purchase".

To run the program, you will need a db.properties file, where you can specify your database settings. 
This file takes place in the directory ${user.home}/ShopThing/.
You have to specify the path, the username and the password.
I will put an example file in this repository.
